# Personal-JS
This repository is used to keep up to date on my JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other web development tools skills. It will host any personal javascript projects that I am working on and plan to display.

--------------The current list of projects------------------
Sudoku
------
This is an ongoing project to better understand and utalize the WaveFuntionCollapse algorithm and entropy in world/texture generation.
Eventually I plan to work on a 2d generator using uploaded tiles and rules in how they connect to generate various sudo random images using this algorithm.


Piano Visualizer
----------------
At this time I am a practicing pianist and have grown facinated with piano visualizers on youtube and other platforms.
This led to interest in midi connection and how a computer will read the various inputs from a keyboard/piano.

The eventual plan is to develop and host an online piano visualizer with various options and settings done entierly hosted in the webpage though this is proving difficult with a lot of midi tools being/becoming depreciated.
