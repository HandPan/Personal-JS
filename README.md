# Personal-JS
This repository is used to keep up to date on my JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other web development tools skills. It will host any personal javascript projects that I am working on and plan to display.

The current list of projects
----------------------------
Sudoku
------
This is an ongoing project to better understand and utalize the WaveFuntionCollapse algorithm and entropy in world/texture generation.
This project has reached its end in this repository. It has since moved to my own personal repo in which it will soon be included with some user acessibility and UX modifications to my own personal site.
Users will soon be able to have control over multiple settings to allow for the best understanding of the underlying functions and principles.

Wave-Function Image Generator
-----------------------------
The cleanest example of the use of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm is in the demonstration in creating similar but different images from a set of base smaller images and rules defining their neighbors.
This is the host location of the project soon to be added live to my personal website.

Piano Visualizer
----------------
At this time I am a practicing pianist and have grown facinated with piano visualizers on youtube and other platforms.
This led to interest in midi connection and how a computer will read the various inputs from a keyboard/piano.

The eventual plan is to develop and host an online piano visualizer with various options and settings done entierly hosted in the webpage though this is proving difficult with a lot of midi tools being/becoming depreciated.
